# firstprojectmanagement
A repository for the project management  practices that include the milestones, issues and project boards.  

# Significance of Milestone 
This milestone helps break the project into smaller, manageable tasks. It keeps the team focused and ensures everyone works towards a clear and shared goal to complete the project's foundation phase.

# How the  Project Board Helps Track Progress:

- **Clear View**: Everyone can easily see what’s happening in the project—what’s done, what’s in progress, and what’s left to do.
- **Accountability**: Each team member knows their tasks and can track their progress.
- **Organized Workflow**: Tasks are neatly sorted into stages (To Do, In Progress, Done), making it easy to follow the project’s progress.
- **Team Alignment**: Regular updates on the board keep everyone on the same page and focused on the right tasks.


# Linking Issues to Milestones:
## Reason for Selection:

- **Fix Bug in User Authorization**: Fixing bugs ensures the core features work properly, which is essential for building a strong foundation.
- **Adding the User Profile Page**: Adding this feature is important because it directly contributes to the main project goals.
Both issues help achieve the milestone by making the project stable and complete in its initial phase.


# Reflection on Project Management Tools:

Using GitHub’s project management tools like milestones, issues, and project boards really helps the team work together and stay organized. Milestones give a clear view of the big goals and deadlines, helping the team focus on what’s most important. Issues break down tasks, making it clear who’s doing what and allowing team members to discuss tasks directly. Project boards give a visual overview of progress, so it’s easy to spot problems and keep the work moving forward.

However, there can be some challenges. Sometimes, team members might forget to update the project board, confusing. Also, when many tasks seem urgent, it can be hard to prioritize them. But by setting clear guidelines and making sure everyone communicates regularly, these issues can be solved, leading to a smoother and more productive workflow.
